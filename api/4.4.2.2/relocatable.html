<h1><a class="anchor" name="relocatable">Relocatable packages</a></h1>Relocatable packages are a way to give the user a little control over the installation location of a package. For example, a vendor may distribute their software to install in "/opt" but you'd like it to install in "/usr/opt". If the vendor were distributing a relocatable RPM package, it would be easy.<p>
Not all software can be "relocatable". Before continuing you should think about how the program works, what files it accesses, what other programs access *it* (and expect it to be in a certain place), etc. If you determine that the location of the package doesn't matter, then it can probably be built as "relocatable".<p>
All you need to do to build a relocatable package is put one or more:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  Prefix: &lt;dir&gt;
</pre></div><p>
in your spec file. The "&lt;dir&gt;" will usually be something like "/usr", "/usr/local", or "/opt". Every file in your files list must start with that prefix. For example, if you have "Prefix: /usr" and your files list contains "/etc/foo.conf", the build will fail. The fix for this is to put<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  Prefix: /usr
  Prefix: /etc
</pre></div><p>
into the spec file so that the /usr and /etc directories may be relocated separately when this package is installed.<p>
By default, RPM will install a relocatable package in the prefix directory listed in the spec file. You can override this on the RPM install command line with "--prefix &lt;dir&gt;". For example, if the package in question were going to be installed in "/opt" but you don't have enough disk space there (and it is a relocatable package), you could install it "--prefix /usr/opt".<p>
If there is more then one Prefix you may relocate each prefix separately by using syntax like:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  rpm ... --relocate /opt=/usr/opt --relocate /etc=/usr/etc ...
</pre></div><p>
If any of the Prefixes is not being relocated they can be skipped on the command line <hr size="1"><address style="text-align: right;"><small>Generated on Fri Oct 12 08:44:57 2007 for rpm by&nbsp;
